Functions:
    - format_username: Format a given username to meet certain application criteria.
    - calculate_score: Calculate a player's final score based on points and bonuses.
"""

def format_username(username):
    """
    Format the provided username to meet the application's criteria.

    any spaces with underscores. This ensures consistency and can aid in 
    data storage, retrieval, and display.

        - bonuses (list of int): A list of bonus values the player has received.

def sanitize_input(input_string):
