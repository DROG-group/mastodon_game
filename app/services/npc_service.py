 """NPC Service Module

This module provides a suite of services for managing and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) within the game environment. 
Key functionalities include:
    - Creating new NPC instances and saving them to the database.
    - Retrieving NPC details based on their usernames.
    - Enabling NPCs to post messages or 'toots'.
    - Managing NPC-user interactions, such as follow actions and handling responses.
    - ... [Add any additional functionalities as they are developed]

Dependencies:
    - app.models.npc: Provides the data models associated with NPCs.
    - app.services.database_service: Offers database interaction services for CRUD operations.

Note: The service functions in this module often interact with the database, which requires committing changes 
to save them persistently. Ensure that database transactions are appropriately handled to avoid data inconsistencies.
