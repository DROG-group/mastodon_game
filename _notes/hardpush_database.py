Overview:
Script to insert data from a CSV file into Mastodon's database.

Functions:

push_data_to_db(row, cur):

Parameters:
row: Data row from the CSV.
cur: Database cursor.
Description: Inserts a single row of data into Mastodon's database. Uses a CTE to check if a user exists, creates a new account if not, and then inserts a status.
insert_mastodon_data_from_csv(csv_path, db_config):

Parameters:
csv_path: Path to the CSV file.
db_config: Database configuration dictionary.
Description: Connects to the database, reads the CSV file, and inserts each row using push_data_to_db.
Usage:

Set up the database configuration.
Call insert_mastodon_data_from_csv with the path to your CSV file and the database configuration.
Note: Direct database manipulation can bypass application-level checks and validations. Use with caution.

here's a breakdown of the CTE logic:
user_check CTE: This checks if a user with the given username exists and returns their account_ID if they do.
new_account CTE: This attempts to insert a new account with the given username and other details. 
If an account with the same username (and domain, if provided) already exists, it performs a dummy update on the username (i.e., it sets the username to its current value). 
Regardless of whether it's an insert or an update, it returns the account_ID.
new_status CTE: This inserts a new status (toot) associated with the account ID determined in the previous steps. 
It uses the COALESCE function to prioritize the account_ID from new_account (if a new account was created or an existing one was updated) and falls back to the account_ID from user_check if no new account was created. 
This means a new status will be created whether the user is new or already exists.
new_user CTE: This inserts a new user associated with the account ID determined in the previous steps. 
Similar to the new_status CTE, it uses the COALESCE function to determine the account_ID.
Final SELECT: This returns the IDs of the newly created or updated account and the newly created status, each with a type label ('account' or 'status').

    Ensures that the id_mapping table exists and is empty.
    If the table exists, it truncates it. If it doesn't, it creates it.

    The `id_mapping` table serves as an essential bridge between the original CSV data and the Mastodon database:
    1. **ID Mismatch**: Mastodon may assign new auto-incremented IDs different from the original CSV IDs.
    2. **Maintain Relationships**: Fields in the CSV, like `in_reply_to_id`, refer to other records. We need to update these references with new Mastodon IDs to preserve relationships.
    3. **Avoid Duplications**: If importing data multiple times, the mapping table helps identify already imported records and prevents duplications.
    4. **Data Auditing**: After data insertion, the table assists in verifying the migration by mapping Mastodon IDs back to their original CSV IDs.

    The function `ensure_id_mapping_table_exists` ensures that this table is ready for each import, either by truncating existing data or creating the table if it doesn't exist.
